# Stack

A Stack is also called Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)

### Stack as an ADT
> A list with restrictions that insertion and deletion can be performed only from one end, called the top.

### Operations

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Sr. No.</th>
      <th>Operation</th>
      <th>Time Complexity</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1.</td>
      <td>Push(x)</td>
      <td rowspan='4'>Constant Time O(1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2.</td>
      <td>Pop()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3.</td>
      <td>Top()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4.</td>
      <td>Isempty()</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Some Applications:-
1. Execution of function calls / Recursion
2. Undo operation of an editor
3. Balancing Brackets in compilers

We can implement stack using
1. Arrays
2. Linked Lists

### ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION OF STACK

### LINKED LIST IMPLEMENTATION OF STACK

### Reverse a String or Linked List using STACK
